    <content>Perfect weather for discovering something a little different...🚵🏽‍♀️ The Lough Gur Cycling Loop, also called the Kilmallock Route 3, is a 62 km (~4 hours) leisurely spin from Kilmallock Library. Download the free Ballyhoura Trails app for directions or head to VisitBallyhoura.com for a downloadable route map.  You'll experience quiet roads, historic landmarks and stunning views of the Lough. Plus, re-fuel with a hot cuppa 🍵 at the Lakeshore Kiosk.  @Munster Vales @Ireland’s Hidden Heartlands @Tourism Ireland @Discover Ireland @Limerick.ie  #ORIS #OurRuralFuture #Ireland2040 #VisitBallyhoura #BallyhouraMoments #MunsterVales #IrelandsHiddenHeartlands #LimerickEdgeEmbrace #DiscoverIreland #KeepDiscovering #GetOutdoors #AdventureTourism #Cycling #WhateverTheWeather #ThingsToDoInIreland #Winter2023 #OutdoorIreland #WinterInIreland #PerfectDiscoveringWeather #KilmallockCyclingHub</content>
